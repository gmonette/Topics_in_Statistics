#' ## Part 1: Introduction
#' 
#' **Slides:** [Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics](Lies_Damned_Lies_And_Statistics.pdf)
#' 
#' **Summary:** Many textbooks warn that it is important to be
#' critical when assessing claims based on analyses of data.
#' Yet few say how. The theme of this presentation is
#' most cases of statistical confusion arise from failing to
#' make two important distinctions.  There are two types of 
#' questions: causal questions and 'predictive' questions, and
#' there are two types of data: observational data -- in which 
#' levels of variables are not manipulated -- and 
#' experimental data in which levels of variables are assigned
#' under the control of an experimenter.  
#' 
#' 'Spurious correlation' is not at all spurious. It is merely
#' 'misunderstood correlation'.  Most perceptions that statistics
#' lie come from failing to make the distinction between
#' association and causation and failing to understand
#' that the rationale for causation comes not so much from 
#' the data themselves but from the way in which the data
#' were collected, specifically the way in which the levels of 
#' variables were assigned.

#' **Exercises:**
#' 
#' 1. Find links to news or blog articles that discuss a current
#'    or recent controversial -- or, at least, debatable -- 
#'    effect of intervention (a drug, diet, health practice,
#'    social or economic policy, etc.) on some outcome (risk of
#'    disease, social outcome, etc.).  Discuss the nature of the
#'    available evidence.  Is it observational or experimental? 
#'    Are the relevant questions causal or predictive?  How does
#'    your analysis help to clarify the controversy?
#'    
#' 2. Find a link to a major journal article in a field in 
#'    which you are interested. Are the conclusions based on
#'    evidence and analysis of data? Are the major questions 
#'    causal or predictive? What kind of data were used?  
#'    Is the structure of the data appropriate for the intended
#'    questions? If causal conclusions are based on observational
#'    data, what strategies did the article use to justify
#'    causal conclusions?
